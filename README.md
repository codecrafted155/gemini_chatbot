Gemini Chatbot Project (Built with Streamlit):
The Gemini Chatbot Project is a user-friendly web application developed using Streamlit, designed to provide seamless conversational experiences powered by Google's Gemini AI (via the Gemini API). This project showcases how developers can quickly build intelligent, interactive chat interfaces by combining powerful large language models with a simple, Python-based frontend framework.

1: Key Features:
Streamlit-Powered UI: Clean, responsive, and interactive web interface built using Streamlit, making it easy to deploy and access from any browser.

Gemini API Integration: Connects with the Gemini Pro or Gemini 1.5 models using the official Gemini API to deliver advanced natural language understanding and generation.

Chat History: Maintains a session-based history of user and AI responses for context-aware conversations.

Multimodal Support (Optional): Can be extended to support image inputs or code snippets, depending on the Gemini model version used.

Easy Deployment: Can be hosted on platforms like Streamlit Community Cloud, Render, or any server with Python installed.

2:installation and run
pip install streamlit
import streamlit
streamlit run app.py

3: Use Cases:
AI-powered personal assistant

Educational or tutoring tool

Customer support prototype

Language learning companion

Creative content generator

4: How it Works:
The user enters a message into the chat interface.

The app sends the prompt to the Gemini model via the Gemini API.

Gemini generates a context-aware response, which is displayed instantly in the chat window.

Conversation history is updated, providing a natural, continuous chat experience.
